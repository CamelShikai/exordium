# What is this repo

Something you probably don't care about. This is my portable Emacs
configuration, synchronized between all my machines.  It is only intended to
work on Emacs 24 running in Linux and OS X, including in -nw mode.

## Content

* C++, including a working CEDET and an experimental RTags
* JavaScript
* Clojure
* Markdown / Org / Ido / Magit / Autocomplete
* A few themes and Powerline
